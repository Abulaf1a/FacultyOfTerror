# Faculty of Terror
The name is work in progess. I am currently creating assets based on Manchester University's Whitworth building, and intend to create a light horror puzzle game set in an abandoned Univeristy building.
The player's fear (and therefore enjoyment) in horror games can be accentuated through tedious tasks, or tasks that require concentration, while they are also trying to escape from the monster.

My game will capitalise on this idea. Though it's not very original, I intend to create some interesting assets and locations that will hopefully set it apart and make it a joy to play. I'm not trying to 
create the scariest game ever but a short, spooky and atmospheric experience with (some) puzzle gameplay (to be determined) and win/lose conditions. 

## To do
1. Refactoring existing code based on SOLID principles - especially splitting player and enemy scripts to follow separation of concerns
2. Incorporating serialisable marker interfaces to make save implementation easier down the line
3. Implementing item interaction from previous project
4. Finishing architectural asset exterior and interior tilesets
5. Lighting/Music/UI/Save/smarter enemy AI, the list goes on.
